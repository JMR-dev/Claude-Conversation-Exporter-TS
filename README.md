# Claude Conversation Exporter

A Chrome extension that allows you to export your Claude.ai conversations in various formats (JSON, Markdown, Plain Text) with support for bulk exports and conversation browsing.

## Features

- üì• **Export Individual Conversations** - Export any conversation directly from Claude.ai
- üìö **Bulk Export** - Export all or filtered conversations as a ZIP file
- üîç **Browse & Search** - View all your conversations in a searchable table
- üå≥ **Branch-Aware Export** - Correctly handles conversation branches (exports only the current branch)
- üìù **Multiple Formats** - JSON (full data), Markdown, or Plain Text
- üóÇÔ∏è **ZIP Archives** - Bulk exports create organized ZIP files with all conversations
- üè∑Ô∏è **Metadata Options** - Include or exclude timestamps, models, and other metadata
- ü§ñ **Complete Model Information** - Preserves and displays model information for all conversations (unlike official Claude.ai exports)
- üîÆ **Smart Model Inference** - Automatically infers the correct model for conversations that used the default model at the time

## Advantages Over Official Claude.ai Export

This extension provides several advantages over the official Claude.ai data export:

1. **Model Information Preserved**: The official export doesn't include which model (Claude 3, 3.5, Opus, Sonnet, etc.) was used for each conversation. This extension preserves and displays this crucial information.

2. **Historical Model Inference**: For conversations that used the default model (which shows as `null` in the data), the extension intelligently infers which model was actually used based on when the conversation occurred and Anthropic's default model timeline.

3. **Instant Export**: No waiting for email delivery - export conversations immediately.

4. **Flexible Formats**: Choose between JSON, Markdown, or Plain Text formats based on your needs.

5. **Selective Export**: Export individual conversations or filter by model, date, or search terms.

6. **Better Organization**: Conversations are exported with meaningful filenames and can be bulk exported into organized ZIP files.

## Chrome Web Store Submission

To prepare for Chrome Web Store submission:

### 1. Create a ZIP for Submission
```bash
cd claude-export
zip -r claude-exporter.zip claude-exporter/ -x "*.DS_Store" -x "*/.git/*"
```

### 2. Prepare Store Listing Assets
You'll need:
- **Screenshots** (1280x800 or 640x400): Take screenshots of the extension in action
- **Promotional Images**: Small tile (440x280), Large tile (920x680) - optional
- **Description**: Use the features list from this README
- **Category**: Suggested: "Productivity" or "Developer Tools"

### 3. Privacy Policy
Since the extension accesses Claude.ai data, you should mention:
- The extension only accesses data when explicitly triggered by the user
- No data is sent to external servers
- All processing happens locally in the browser
- User's Claude.ai authentication is used only for API access

### 4. Permissions Justification
Be ready to explain why each permission is needed:
- `activeTab`: To interact with the current Claude.ai tab
- `storage`: To save user's organization ID
- `scripting`: To inject content scripts for export functionality
- Host permission for `claude.ai`: To access Claude.ai API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### "Organization ID not configured"
- Follow the setup steps in the Configuration section
- Make sure you're copying the complete UUID from the URL

### "Not authenticated" error
- Make sure you're logged into Claude.ai
- Try refreshing the Claude.ai page

### Export fails for some conversations
- Some very old conversations might have different data structures
- Check the browser console for specific error messages
- The ZIP export includes a summary file listing any failed exports

### Content Security Policy errors
- Make sure you're using the latest version of the extension
- Try reloading the extension from chrome://extensions/

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens in your browser
- **No External Servers**: The extension doesn't send data anywhere
- **Your Authentication**: Uses your existing Claude.ai session
- **Open Source**: You can review all code before installation

## Known Limitations

- Plaintext and markdown formats only export the currently selected branch in conversations with multiple branches
- Large bulk exports may take several minutes
- Some special content types (like artifacts) may not export perfectly
- Rate limiting: The extension processes conversations in small batches to avoid overwhelming the API
